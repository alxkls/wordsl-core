# wordsl-core

## Short description

way it works is realy simple - you put any words in launguage you learn during any time notice, than press button
to export list of new words with translation.That's it, you can start learn all this words.

Spring Boot project dedicated to simplify learning new words in any new launguage 
introducing mechanism to input, translate and export heard/seen words during dayly life.
Might be helpful for students or any one who learns new language or focus to expand vocablurary

wordsl-core is a list of APIs perfoming input of any word, translating, creating record in the database and exporting 
records to the user when it is requested.

As a UI there is suggestion to use chat-bot in  messanger for any mobile device such as Telegram. UI would contain 
a couple of buttons responsible for intoraction and would securly authenticate a user since user account is verified 
withing messenger.
Alternativelyh it is also possible to build front-end to do the same thing, it this case we would need to think more
about identifying and verefication for potential consumers
If we prefer hardcore - create mobile app solution
